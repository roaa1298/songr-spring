# Songr app

- I created this app by [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/).
- You can run this app and then open the localhost url by this port 8080 .  
   - for Home page : (http://localhost:8080/) .
   - for hello world page : (http://localhost:8080/hello) .
   - for capitalizer page : (http://localhost:8080/capitalize/word).
   - for albums page : (http://localhost:8080/albums)
   - to add album in the albums page : (http://localhost:8080/addAlbum)

- before we run our code we should start the postgres server by **sqlstart** command. and then we can connect to our database or create a database if we didn't create it before by **psql** command, and then we can run our application and see our table that is generated from the application.
